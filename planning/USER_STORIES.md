## User Stories

### Core (MVP)

- As a user, I should be able to create a project in order to organize and store my files
- As a user, I should be able to invite other users to be collaborators on a project so that we can work together
- I should be able to record a track and store it in my project
- I should be able to assign/unassign files to a project
- I should be able to see all projects that I am a part of in a list of some sort so that I can easily access them
- I should be able to add/remove users in a project if I am the admin of the project
- I should be able to see a list of unassigned files

### Stretch

- I want to be able to combine multiple tracks so that collaborators can make a song together
- I should be able to make my projects/songs public or private depending on whether or not I want non-collaborators to be able to listen
