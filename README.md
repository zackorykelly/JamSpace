### Usage

- Once you're logged in/registered, create a new project using the plus icon. Click on your new project to access it. From here you can add collaborators using their email address (tell them to register first), as well as listen to and record tracks. At the top of the page, there are play, pause, and reset buttons that will trigger on all revealed tracks so that you can listen to some, or all tracks at once. When recording, you also have the option to "record with playback", which will play back all revealed tracks during the recording.

## Dependencies
